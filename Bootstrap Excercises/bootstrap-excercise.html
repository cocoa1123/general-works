			<p> <a href="contacts.html" class="nav"> Contacts </a> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
			Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and 
			scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
			remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
			and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

				<p>A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available 
				(stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). 
				The following HTML Elements: <code>div</code>, <code>h1</code> and <code>p</code> are block elements. </br>
				An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
				Elements like <code>span</code>, <code>a</code> and <code>img</code> are examples of inline elements.</p>
				</br>
				<p>Use <kbd>Ctrl + c</kbd> to copy some text and <kbd>Ctrl + v</kbd> to paste it.</p>
